# pydantic-forms
pydantic-form-model is a Python library that lets you easily define dynamic, structured forms using Pydantic classes and serve form definitions from your backend application. By calling the .to_form_fields() method on your form model, you get a JSON-serializable FormField object that includes validation rules, labels, hints, styling, render conditions, and more. It supports a wide range of field types—including NumberFields, TextFields, DateTimeFields, FileFields, SelectFields, BooleanFields, as well as nested ListFields and ObjectFields—making it ideal for building complex, customizable form UIs directly from Python code.


Best used in conjunction with a FastAPI backend which serializes pydantic objects per default and vue-dynamic-headless-forms for a frontend integration that can be used to parse and render the form fields.
